<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">Challenge: Add more stats to the robots</h2>
--- task ---
Think of more stats to add to the robots.
--- /task ---

You could add ‘speed’ or ‘usefulness’ or come up with your own ideas. 

You’ll need to:

+ Add data to the file for each new category 
+ Add the new category to the code that read in the data
+ Write the new category out when you display a trump card

You could even add a colour and show the stats for robots in their own color. 

Hint: Use `color('red')` to change the turtle's text to red before writing. 

Example:
